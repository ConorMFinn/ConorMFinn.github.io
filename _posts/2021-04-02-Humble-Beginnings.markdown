My first step to motorbike ownership... I have a CBT certificate! This tells my insurance company or a nosy police officer that I have completed the UK's Compulsory Basic Training for motorcycle competence. This basically means that I'm slightly less likely to kill myself or others if I'm out on the road.

The day began with meeting my instructor and the other person I'd be spending the day with, James. I was going to be riding a geared, 125cc Lexmoto ZSB motorbike, and he'd be on a 125cc scooter. We were then taken to the bikes and given some information on proper care and maintenance. This included two acronyms: 

BEST COPS (done every week or so):
  
B: Brakes  
E: Electrics  
S: Suspension  
T: Tyres  
C: Chain  
O: Oil  
P: Petrol  
S: Steering  

and BOLTS (done before each ride):

B: Brakes  
O: Oil  
L: Lights  
T: Tyres  
S: Steering  

Given that James, the other student, had already done the CBT and knew how to ride, I was then shown how to take the bike off its centre stand: Lean it back and push it forwards. Then I had to get it back on... It is at this moment I reach to grab the front brake, lean *slightly* too far, and 125kg of motorbike overpowers 60kg of me and we both fall to the floor in a heap. 

Welp... better my first drop happens to someone elses bike. 

With the only damage being to my shins and my pride; we continue with some low speed manuevers, learning how to approach junctions, and how to use both the clutch and rear brake to control my speed (rather than the throttle).

After that, we go to lunch, do a bit of highway code study, and then it's time to gear up for the road practice. We're both on the receiving end of a one way radio from our instructor, who talks us through each manoeuver. We pulled over a few times to practice U-turns and emergency stops, and then headed out onto the more open roads. This is where I really wish James wasn't on a scooter. I was desperate to open the taps and go for some corners. But when forced to follow a scooter that taps out at 33mph, it's just not possible.

It was on the country lanes that I fell in love. Even on the most uncomfortable seat in the world, I never wanted to stop. Opening the taps and hearing that exhaust note right behind you is such a rush. 

I would tell anyone who is confused by people who ride motorbikes to just book a CBT and give it a go. The instructors are usually delightful and really passionate. They'll talk you through everything and make sure whatever you're doing is safe and secure. 

You might just discover it's the hobby you've always been waiting for.
