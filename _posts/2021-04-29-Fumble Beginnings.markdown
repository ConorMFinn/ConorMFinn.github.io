As of today, I've been riding on my own for about a week. I have already fallen off. My membership to the "nevers" group ended the day after I got the bike. 

Decided to practice my low speed u-turns and got flustered, pulled a bunch of front brake and slowly toppled onto my right side like and old tree. With the only damage to my pride and my right side fender, I just gotta pull back and keep practicing. 

But on to the bike.

It's a GSX-S125, the naked version of the mini GSX-R125 sports bike. It also has an aftermarket exhaust fitted that makes it sound like an unbearably loud fart. It's the only thing wrong with it and I'm buying a stock one at the next available opportunity. 

Good god it's fun. Even at perfectly normal speeds, there's just something exciting about riding. 60 feels like 100, thanks to the force of the wind and the sound of the engine right beneath you. Filtering is fantastic, being able to skip through traffic is just so satisfying. 

There has been precisely one downside so far... I already want a bigger one.
